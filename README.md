# soccerscorer
Within this project, our goal is to predict the soccer game result (like home win, away win, draw) before the match is played. This will be managed by processing the several attributes of the players and teams separately. The system will input the basic properties of players and teams, then will output the predicted result of the match. Most favorite soccer dataset is used in this project. Dataset is publicly available under following link: https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer/data
