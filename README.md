Within this project, the main goal is to predict the soccer game results like a home team win, an away team win and draw before the match is played. This was managed by processing the several attributes of the teams and players. The system takes the basic properties of teams and players as input, then it gives the predicted result of the matches as output. Artificial Neural Network was used for implementing the model.
